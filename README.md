### Hi there 👋

I am the Principal Engineering Lead at [OakNorth](https://www.oaknorth.co.uk/) 🌳, and was previously with [@R3](https://www.r3.com/) ⛓ and [Hudl](https://www.hudl.com/) ⚽️. Some Open Source projects that I have been involved with are [Corda](https://github.com/corda/corda), [GraphQL.NET](https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet) and [Conventions](https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/conventions). You can find miscellaneous thoughts and findings in my [blog](https://tlil.github.io/).
